# Custom NPC Names Mod

**DISCLAIMER**  
The development of this mod is currently on hold. Much of the features were implemented and ready
to go for Terraria 1.3.x, but since then new NPCs were added in the 1.4 update and (as of writing
this) tModLoader still has not updated to 1.4, which stalls further work. If tModLoader 1.4 is
already out and this disclaimer is still here, then I'm probably procrastinating or I'm preoccupied
with other work.

## Info

Ever get bored of the default NPC names?
This mod adds an on-screen editor which allows you to rename your town NPCs to whatever you want!
Only the vanilla NPCs are and probably will ever be supported.
 
[FEATURES] v1.0.0

+ Edit names manually,
+ Create lists of names to randomize from,
+ Randomize with respect to profession, gender or nothing.
