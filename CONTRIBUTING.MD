I never planned this mod to grow beyond the features I'm going to add myself.
That said if anyone wants to improve it, I don't see a problem.

## CONDITIONS

1. You cannot add *anything* that would interfere with vanilla-only gameplay experience of the player.
2. Chances are if you try anything too complex for me to understand I will not allow it. It might sound selfish of me, but I want to have full control and understanding of what's going on and how this mod works.

Your best bet might be contacting me directly before trying to contribute, it could potentially save you a lot of your precious time.
