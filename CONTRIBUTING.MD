# Contributing

I never planned this mod to grow beyond the features I'm going to add myself.
That said if anyone wants to improve it, I don't see a problem.

## CONDITIONS

1. You cannot add *anything* that would interfere with vanilla-only experience of the player. This is necessary so that speedrunners can use this mod without having to call their run "modded".
2. Chances are if you try anything too complex for me to understand I will not allow it. I know might sound selfish of me, but I want to be in full charge and comprehension of what's going on and how this mod works.

Your best bet might be contacting me directly before trying to contribute, it could potentially save you a lot of your precious time.
