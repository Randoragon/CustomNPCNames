This mod adds an on-screen editor which allows you to rename your town NPCs to whatever you want!
Only the vanilla NPCs are and probably ever will be supported.

+ Create lists of names to randomize from,
+ Randomize with respect to profession, gender or nothing.
 
If you encounter any bugs, be sure to open an issue on the GitHub homepage. You'll find the full source code there as well.
